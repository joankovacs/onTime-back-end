# onTime

## Concept

onTime Routine Planner is a time visualization tool and planner for daily tasks and events. It allows users to back-plan departures and prep time needed to complete a customizable list of tasks, aka a "routine", where individual task start times are pre-determined based on the routine's desired completion time.

Originally conceptualized as a time management tool for neuro-divergent children and adults, onTime can be used by anyone looking to stay organized-- or help others stay organized-- and on track in their day. 

## Features

Routines can be created from a list of the user's favorited tasks, and can also include one-time only tasks for just that routine. Routines can be saved for reuse at a later time, or be created for one-time use only.

When a routine is selected, a display screen shows the user the time to start each task in the routine in order to be done by the pre-determined time.

Users can "play" the routine while completing tasks, and the display will inform the user how much time is left on a given task and alert them to change tasks when the time runs out. If the user completes a task early, they can initiate the next task and "save" time. 

Task time is represented in both analog and digital form. Clean, uncluttered UI maximizes ease of use for all ages.

## Tech Stack

onTime's back-end is written in Python, utilizing Flask and a PostgreSQL database.
