# onTime

## Concept

onTime is a time visualization tool and routine planner for daily tasks and events. It allows users to back-plan departures and prep time needed to complete a customizable list of tasks, aka a "routine", where individual task start times are pre-determined based on the routine's desired completion time.

Originally conceptualized as a time management tool for neuro-divergent children and adults, onTime can be used by anyone looking to stay organized-- or help others stay organized-- and on track in their day. If you or a loved one struggle with getting ready to leave the house on time, identifying or remembering tasks and task order, staying focused on the task at hand, or managing activity transitions, onTime can help!

## Current Features

- Create new routines and save them for later use
- Easily modify allotted time for each task and instantly update total routine time
- Add a "complete by" time to see when to start each task in the routine
- "Play" a routine to step through each task with the time visualizer tool

  - Task time represented visually in both analog form

## Tech Stack

onTime's back-end is written in Python, utilizing Flask and a PostgreSQL database. The front-end is built with React.
